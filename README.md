# The Language-Integrated Quantum Operations (LIQ<i>Ui</i>|&#x232A;) simulator

## News
__2016/07/02 Sample implementation of Spin.Test and Stabilizer.ShowState released__

In UserCode\DaveWecker there are two new releases of sample implementations. The first shows how to implement the Spin.Test routine that's caled by the `__Ferro()` example in LIQ<i>Ui</i>\|&#x232A;. There's also a new property on stabilizers called `Tableau` which will return the current (raw) stabilizers. See the `Tableau.fsx` sample in the same directory for further information. The [README.md](UserCode/DaveWecker/README.md) file is a good place to start.

__2016/05/20 Channels/POVMs added__

We've made a major addition to the available noise models in the system by adding Channels (via Kraus operators) and Generalized Measurement (via POVMs). The Users Manual has a new
section under "Advanced Noise Models" called "Channels and POVMs", the API docs have been updated and there's a new built in example called `__Kraus`. A sample call would be: 
`__Kraus(1000,0.02,.02,true)` which would do 1000 runs with Amplitude Damping and Depolarizing noise. See the Users Manual for full details as well as the provided source code in `Samples\Kraus.fsx`.
You can also find an example of a simple quantum game (Peres) using POVMs in the `UserCode\MartinRoettler` directory.

__2016/05/16 First Quantum Challenge Winners announced!__

The winners of the first Quantum Challenge have been announced in the [Microsoft Research Blog](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/msr_er/2016/05/16/microsoft-quantum-challenge-results-are-in/).
Full information about the entries may be found in our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/StationQ/Liquid/tree/master/QuantumChallenge/QC_1).

__2016/05/03 QuAM source code released__

In UserCode\DaveWecker there's a new release of source code for the QuAM example that's built in to LIQ<i>Ui</i>\|&#x232A;. See the [README.md](UserCode/DaveWecker/README.md) file in the same directory for details. We also exposed a few more APIs to help make this and other examples easier to code.

__2016/04/23 QLSA source code released__

In UserCode\DaveWecker there's a new release of source code for the QLSA example that's built in to LIQ<i>Ui</i>\|&#x232A;. See the [README.md](UserCode/DaveWecker/README.md) file in the same directory for details.

__2016/03/11 New introduction videos__

Seven new short videos have been posted to the [LIQ<i>Ui</i>\|&#x232A; Research site](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/liquid/)

__2016/03/04 Outputting circuits for other Quantum Languages__

We've uploaded sample code that shows how to print out circuits for other quantum languages. This specific example shows how to parse a circuit and generate QASM code. See [UserCode example](https://github.com/StationQ/Liquid/tree/master/UserCode/DaveWecker) from DaveWecker

## What Is LIQ<i>Ui</i>|&#x232A;?

LIQ<i>Ui</i>|&#x232A; is a simulation platform developed by the [Quantum Architectures and Computation](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/groups/quarc/) team at Microsoft Research to aid in the exploration of quantum computation. 
LIQ<i>Ui</i>|&#x232A; stands for “Language Integrated Quantum Operations”.  
A quantum operation is usually referred to as a unitary operator (U) applied to a column state vector (also known as a ket: |>).
The “i” is just a constant scaling factor, hence the acronym.

LIQ<i>Ui</i>|&#x232A; includes three simulators: 
* A full state vector simulator that tracks the detailed evolution of the quantum state
* A stabilizer simulator based on CHP (Aaronson and Gottesman, http://arXiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0406196)
* A highly-optimized full state vector simulator for fermionic Hamiltonians

LIQ<i>Ui</i>|&#x232A; is available under a [Microsoft Research license](LICENSE.md).

## What Can I Do With It?

You can use LIQ<i>Ui</i>|&#x232A; to define quantum circuits, render them into a variety of graphical formats, and execute them
using an appropriate simulator.

Some of the specific algorithms you can simulate with LIQ<i>Ui</i>|&#x232A; are:
* Simple quantum teleportation
* Shor's factoring algorithm
* Quantum chemistry: computing the ground state energy of a molecule
* Quantum error correction
* Quantum associative memory (Ventura and Martinez, http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9807053)
* Quantum linear algebra (Harrow, Hassidim, and Lloyd, http://arxiv.org/abs/0811.3171)

All of these algorithms, and many more, are included as samples with LIQ<i>Ui</i>|&#x232A;.
